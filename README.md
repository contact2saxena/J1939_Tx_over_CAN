# J1939_Tx_over_CAN
In test/src/transmitest.cpp is used to transmit J1939 messeges from linux command line in hexadecimal. Before that you have to install the PEAK Can drivers in the system. The application can be modified according to needs. Application will work only with PEAK CAN modules because I've modified the standard source code of standard peak can driver test application. Executable will be found at test/ after compiling.
